When we run hyp_dance(30), first 30 plots were made using maximum margin with hinge loss.
In each of the iteration seperable data was sampled and we saw the yellow plane was almost stable.
The next 30 iterations were used perceptron, which does not try to maximize margin. So it may settle for 
any hyperplane separating the datasets. Hence the cyan hyperplane seems to wobble with every iteration.
